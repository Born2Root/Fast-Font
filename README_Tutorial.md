# Intro
I was recently active with FontLab again, so I made some screenshots to make it easier for other users to get active.

First of all, open a font-file with FonLab.

Afterwards open the "Feature" Panel if it is not already visible.

Now you can start adding OpenType features.
The one that is use for the bionic speed reading functionality is "calt" contextual alternatives.
If it is not already included in the font you can add it via the + symbol.

Afterwards just add the whole program code that you can find in the repo.
[opentype_feature.fea](https://github.com/Born2Root/Fast-Font/blob/main/opentype_feature.fea)

Use the code as it is or alternate it as you wish.
Afterwards test the font and export it.

## Export the font
If you want the speed reading variation of the font alongside the original font, you should rename it.
To do this click on the little information "I" and change the name in the following window.
I would recommend to just add a suffix to the font, like Fast or Speed.
